I'm a Master graduate in Earth Science who is passionate in seismology and volcanoes. I like to code in Python (frequently used modules: matplotlib, scipy, numpy,  obspy, pandas, scikit-learn) and bash (with some useful tools and commands, such as: awk, grep, rsync, ssh, scp, etc.) to tackle my computing problems in geoscience. I currently am trying to learn more about machine learning and database. Other than that, I can comfortably understand codes written in other programming languages (due to necessity), such as: Fortran, Matlab, perl, even emacs lisp (I prefer to avoid this one if I can). 

I used to sit for hours writing on LaTeX because the pdf made is a form of art. I also think that spending time to embellish my map using Generic Mapping Tools is worth it (instead of using a pirated-software to click and easily create one).
